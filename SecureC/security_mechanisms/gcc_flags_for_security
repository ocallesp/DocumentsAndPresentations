-Wall -Wextra 
Turn on all warnings to help ensure the underlying code is secure.

-Wconversion -Wsign-conversion
Warn on unsign/sign conversion

-Wformat­security
Warn about uses of format functions that represent possible security problems

-Werror 
Turns all warnings into errors.

-arch x86_64 
Compile for 64-bit to take max advantage of address space (important for ASLR; more virtual address space to chose from when randomising layout).

-fstack-protector-all -Wstack-protector --param ssp-buffer-size=4 
Your choice of "-fstack-protector" does not protect all functions (see comments). You need -fstack-protector-all to guarantee guards are applied to all functions, although this will likely incur a performance penalty. Consider -fstack-protector-strong as a middle ground. 
The -Wstack-protector flag here gives warnings for any functions that aren't going to get protected.

-pie -fPIE 
For ASLR

-ftrapv 
Generates traps for signed overflow (currently bugged in gcc)

-­D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 ­O2
Buffer overflow checks. See also difference between =2 and =1

­-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now
RELRO (read-only relocation). The options relro & now specified together are known as "Full RELRO". You can specify "Partial RELRO" by omitting the now flag. RELRO marks various ELF memory sections read­only (E.g. the GOT)
